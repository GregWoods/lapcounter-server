# 2023 Prioritised To Do List

- [ ] (Separate Project) ! Get CarID programmer working.
    - [ ] Maybe design a 3D printed case for it to clip to the side of a track piece (avoiding copper tape)  
    - [ ] Consider getting a PCB made, even if it uses the same module based electronmics... It avoids those terrible coloured push buttons
- [y] (unrelated) Build foamboard ramp with supports for double apex turn
- [y] (unrelated) Program the yellow controller to the yellow lane 
     

## Hardware Enhancements

Hardware Enhancements would enable a lot more features going forward, but maybe I should finish the car selector first

- [ ] Read track data
    - [ ] Enabled reading throttle state
        - [ ] For auto yellow flag with penalties
        - [ ] For fuel burn
- [ ] RFID intgegration
    - [ ] Very useful for big race meets

## Software Enhancements
