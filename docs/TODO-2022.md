TODO: Move these to GitHub issues, prioritise and add details


Bigger Features
---------------

- [ ] Integration with RFID
- [ ] End of Race summary. Ordered list P1 to P6 with race times, fastest laps and number of laps completed (or number of laps behind)
    - [ ] Show a leaderboard UI once the chequered flag is out (more obvious that we have a winner and that everyone is expected to finish their current lap)
- [ ] Last man standing mode. Driver is removed from the leaderboard and laps are no longer counted if they drop more than x seconds behind leader
- [ ] New settings page with 'tabs' on left, so we can group settings, and have a lot more of them
- [ ] Individual web pages optimised for mobile showing more detailed info about your race
- [ ] Vertical screen mode

- [ ] Separate RP2040 based track data reader for fuel usage and throttle readings
- [ ] Separate relay module to kill track power
- [ ] Smart pit integration (although this is probably a separate device)
- [ ] Badges and accomplishments (useful addition to personal RFID card). Based on things like...
    - [ ] Number of races participated in
    - [ ] Number of laps without incident (not sure how to detect without reading track data)
    - [ ] Number of consecutive laps without incident (clean driver award)
    - [ ] Race director could give personal awards :)


LOW
----
- [ ] [CONSIDER]: Lap Penalties (would need to be a setting)
    - [ ] If we decided on "All drivers must stop on track on yellow flag"... instead of just NOT counting laps, we could ADD extra laps if a driver crosses the line under yellow flag. If we had throttle data, we could detect throttle press during yellow flag - which is better than crossing the line.

- [ ] BUG: prevent closing start lights modal by clicking background or ESC. Prevent Space bar yellow flag when start lights on
- [ ] Better initialisation of drivers and lapDataDefault.. they are both damned ugly!
- [ ] animated position changes... cannot use css flex ordering. Need to use coordiates?
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18846481/use-transition-on-flexbox-order
    https://isotope.metafizzy.co/ - Mmmm looks nice
- [ ] Better initialisation of drivers and lapDataDefault.. they are both damned ugly!
- [ ] Chequered Flag animation. Maybe in Header, or in DriverCardPosition
- [ ] Add performace settings. Raspi and Laptop/Desktop
    - [ ] suggest 3 settings (1) All animations on , (2) blur off, darken opacity to compensate, translations on, (3) All transitions/animations off.  * Also look at optimising if possible
- [ ] Allow recovery from page refresh
    - [ ] Back up state in localstorage. Google approaches to doing this (if anyone is doing it)    
- [ ] BUG: height is no longer correct. Page slightly too short!
- [ ] Darker bg color to compensate for lack of blur
- [ ] Try OpenSans or Selawik (SegoeUI is not Open Source). Download and include in the webserver
    - [ ] try dejavu  droid  freefont  liberation2  noto  piboto  quicksand, 
    - [ ] remove installed segoeUI
- [ ] Replace logo192.png and logo512.png with a chequered flag logo. 
    What is manifest.json all about?    
- [ ] UI to change title (and persist to localstorage)
- [ ] Localization



Settings Page
-------------
Keep ideas in here. Top level is tabs

- [ ] Connection - split websocket url into 2 fields
    - [ ] websocket server IP address
    - [ ] websocket server port 
    - [ ] related help info
    - [ ] don't expect user to enter ws:// (but don't cause errors if they do)
- [ ] Display
    - [ ] Comments on fixed resolution
    - [ ] Vertical/Horizontal orientation
    - [ ] Performance
        - [ ] Desktop
        - [ ] Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Track LAyout
    - [ ] Finish line in front of starting grid (preferred. First lap is longer. Doesn't mess up fastest laps)
        Drivers start on lap -1, cross the line marks lap 0, and first counted lap is at lap 1 (lap 0 is ignored)
    - [ ] Finish line is behind the starting grid
        Behaviour TBC


To Consider
-----------
- [ ] We could take advantage of first-car-across-the-line-starts-the-race to implement a rolling start feature
- [ ] A cool restart effect would be to replace the yellow/black flashing overlay with a green overlay (instant-on) which fades out of existence
    - [ ] THe same effect could be used when the lights go out on the initial start. This gives some consistency between the start and the end of yellow flag
- [ ] Maybe? Introduce small random delay between. Clicking race restart green flag, and yellow flag ending

- [ ] Allow a driver to join a race partway through. As soon as they cross the line, they are positioned a fixed 'X' laps behind the last placed driver
- [ ] Fast Forward mode... if a driver gets too many laps behind, they get fast forwarded to be only 'X' laps behind last place (the nmber of laps should be adjustable)
- [ ] Joker - allows you to skip a number of laps
    - [ ] could be fixed number
    - [ ] variable number, based on number of laps between you and car in front
    - [ ] variable based onnumber of laps between you and car behind (so you play joker when there are along way ahead of the car behind you
    - [ ] variable based on number of laps between you and the leader
    - [ ] variable based on number of laps between you and second place
    - [ ] probably not available within 'x' laps from the end
    - [ ] UI makes it really obvious is has been played
- [ ] store all lap data for post race analysis and graphing
    - [ ] use state initially
    - [ ] possibly use localstorage 
    - [ ] permanent db backup for long term stats  
- [ ] Hardware: implement NFC reader
- [ ] Consider using Context instead of Refs. Also means less prop passing for "global" data
- [ ] Implement separate 'pages' for each driver



Tech Debt
---------
- [ ] Used a ref without state. I suspect some other refs could be simplified to not use state
- [ ] resolve conflicting uses of preset.id and idx. Should prob always use id
- [ ] add the autostart stuff to a setup script
- [ ] DOCS: Installed segoeUI on Raspi: https://github.com/mrbvrz/segoe-ui-linux


Design Goals and Philosophy
===========================
My aim here is to do what I can with what we have.
Without additional hardware mods I do not have access to throttle data, and I cannot control power to the drivers cars. This has affected some design decisions. 
I have never agreed with trying to emulate every aspect of 1:1 racing. Slot car racing is a thing in it's own right. It can never simulate being on a race track, so I am averse to doing things like simulating tyre wear or weather conditions or mechanical failures. Slot racing has it's own challenges including real mechanical problems, tyres picking up dirt and losing traction, and depending on track and tyres, rubber being deposited on the track.
Fuel usage is something I would like to simulate, but only when I can get hold of driver throttle data. I will not
implement fuel usage based on a simple timer. It has to be based on how heavy handed you are as a driver.
Whilst I would love to implement forced speed limits during yellow flags, and forced pit lane penalties for bad behaviour, the only way i can penalise drivers is by not counting laps. Future features will take advantage of this

When it comes to the UI design, my main goal is readability, and I have tried to concentrate on the absolutely required information with only a little in the way of extras to give spectators something to look at. During a race, it is difficult enough just glancing up and seeing your position. Trying to analyse your last lap time is extremely difficult! Whilst I could have shown your last X lap times, this info is not really viable when viewing a TV or monitor from 10 feet away.

Real world testing, has shown to me that by dynamically reordering the "DriverCards" based on position, the 
leaderboard is easier to read. Showing laps remaining is more useful than Laps Driven, and although I experimented with showing number of laps behind the leader, in the end, it made the design look more cluttered and added little to the drivers experience.

KNOWN ISSUE: we cannot start race timing from the moment the lights go out, because with the current python code, there is only one-way commuication from the python lap counting code to the front end code. The python code, which gives us timing info every time the car crosses the line, is unaware of the race start time. In practice it shouldn't be an issue, as race timing begins when the first driver crosses the line (confirm this). All timings and positions are based on this.




Done
=====

- [x] test raspi 4B with blur etc ON
    - [x] Still unusable with blur on - though I haven't tried setting the various chromium GPU flags
    - [x] A lot faster loading up, and slightly smoother menu animations than Pi 3A+ 512Mb


- [x] Raspi 3A+ is working
```
    cd ~/.config
    mkdir lxsession
    cd lxsession
    mkdir LXDE-pi
    cd LXDE-pi
    nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
        (do not sudo this)
        (copeid from /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart)
    @lxpanel --profile LXDE-pi
    @pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE-pi
    @xscreensaver -no-splash
    /usr/bin/chromium-browser --start-fullscreen --disable-restore-session-state http://127.0.0.1
```

- [x] Code changes to make it work on the 3A+
    - [x] Remove blur effect completely
    - [x] Remove background-color change transition 



- [x] Tried on BRIX03 running Chromium on Debian10. Better, but not good enough. Moving menus is bad. 
    Didn't need to install it, I served it from my desktop http://10.0.1.7:3000  
    I DON'T NEED TO DEVELOP DIRECTLY ON THE RASPI! I develop locally and test on the Pi/Brix
    
- [x] Try the BRIX03 with Windows 10 and Chrome (ensure graphics drivers are OK)
    - [x] use --disable-gpu option in Chrome and f12 -> performance -> 6x slower GPU. It is nice and janky!
    - [x] disable blur completely. Supersmooth on BRIX. This is the way to go

Benchmarks

- [x] create a version with only background opacity changes and no animations/transitions, and test on the Pi 3B+


Raspi Install
=============
- [x] Ordered Raspi 4B+ (4Gb) from ebay.It should at least enable me to run local VSCode to try things out

- [ ] Raspi 3B+
    - [x] Cannot get Segoe UI to show in my react app. Now using my own script
    - [x] 3B+ CSS transitions still TERRIBLE - Abandoned making these better. They are too low priority
        - [x] openGL works, glxgears runs at 60fps
            * Chromium claims to be hw accelerated, but I suspect it is the rasterization which is the problem for the effects I use.
            * Bullseye may be buggy. pi-apps thinks so
        - [x] Animations are TERRIBLE! Any way to speed up raspi (GPU rendering?)
            - [x] TRY enabling hardware GPU in Chromium: : https://lemariva.com/blog/2020/08/raspberry-pi-4-video-acceleration-decode-chromium
            - [x] Improving speed of css animations: https://medium.com/outsystems-experts/how-to-achieve-60-fps-animations-with-css3-db7b98610108            
        - [x] try enabling GPU stuff in Chromium


- [x] One smooth animation option is an old BRIX from work

- [x] start raspi in fullscreen mode (--kiosk is another option, but is difficult to break out of)
    ref: https://labs.tadigital.com/index.php/2019/07/26/raspberry-pi-config-to-open-a-web-page-with-hidden-cursor-on-boot/

    sudo nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
    Add...
    @/usr/bin/chromium-browser --start-fullscreen

    - [ ] !!! This has got rid of the DESKTOP! Look into why

- [ ] Consider fresh install of raspi OS lite and start from scratch (new SD card to be safe)

- [x] Installed segoeUI on Raspi

    




Explanation of End of Race Behaviour
------------------------------------
The quirky looking behaviour is correct!
P1 crosses the line
THe next person to cross the line gets P2, even if they are 10 laps behind
The next person to cross the line may be only 6 laps behind, so now they are P2
Either we accept that they will jump around (BAD!)
Or we base it on the last lap until everyone finishes their lap, so less severe jumping around (SLIGHTLY BETTER)
Or we hold off all positions until everyone has finished their lap. Just show chequered flag as each person crosses the line
??What does it look like if we remove the "finished" condition from the positional sorting?
Provisionally looks better, second person across the line  may legitimately be P6
